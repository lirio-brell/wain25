        Personalization, the adaptation of products and services to individual preferences, is crucial 
        for modern businesses seeking to enhance customer satisfaction. With the integration of artificial 
        intelligence technologies, digital systems can now achieve large-scale personalization. 
        Companies like Netflix, Facebook, and Amazon leverage personalization to increase revenue and 
        expand their customer base. In the education sector, personalized technologies are being 
        developed to create tailored learning experiences for each student based on their abilities, 
        background, and preferences. The demand for personalized content extends across various applications, 
        including precision marketing and precision healthcare.

        Nudging has been widely used by decision-makers and organizations, both government and private, 
        to influence the behavior of target populations. In the digital world, digital nudging employs 
        user-interface design elements to guide people’s behavior in digital choice environments. 
        Examples include emails encouraging vaccination, text messages promoting counseling services 
        during exam weeks, and marketing messages through various digital media. With the increasing 
        availability of big data, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data science 
        (DS) technologies have the potential to transform data-driven nudging and decision-making. 
        This workshop aims to create a new community around AI for nudging and explore the state of 
        the art in AI/ML/DS-based systems and applications of digital nudging.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We welcome contributions from researchers across disciplines who are developing AI/ML/DS 
        technologies that impact human behavior based on nudging theory, personalization, or 
        behavioral science solutions. For instance, in the context of public health communications, 
        how can AI/ML address constructing messages incorporating nudges? How can we digitally nudge 
        people toward better healthcare outcomes, improved financial decisions, or increased productivity? 
        Additionally, what are the key challenges related to data, technology, privacy, ethics, adoption, 
        and scaling in nudging and personalization? We’re also interested in case studies that explore 
        the effectiveness of nudges and personalization in maximizing specific outcomes, as well as 
        how AI/ML systems can nudge individuals toward better decisions. Industry insights on how nudging 
        and personalization technologies influence consumer behavior are particularly valuable for our workshop.
