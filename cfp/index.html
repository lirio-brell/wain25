    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        Nudging has been widely used by decision makers and organizations (both government and private) to influence 
        the behavior of target populations, and the concept of nudging is now being widely used in the digital world. 
        Examples of digital nudging include emails from hospitals or public health officials encouraging individuals 
        to get vaccinated, text messages from colleges to stressed-out students to advertise the availability of 
        counseling services during exam weeks, marketing messages through various digital media, and user interfaces 
        designed to guide people’s behavior in digital choice environments.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The central idea behind nudging is to make small changes to the environments in which citizens make decisions 
        to encourage better behaviors. Even though nudges have traditionally involved simple changes that are easy and 
        inexpensive to implement, more complex and sustained behavior change requires more complex interventions, 
        presenting new challenges for nudging in the virtual world. Though the concept of nudging has been popularized 
        recently, nudges have been in use in various aspects of society for a long time, including in healthcare, public 
        health policy, law, economics, politics, insurance, finance, and advertising. With increasing availability of 
        big data from many scientific disciplines, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data science (DS) 
        technologies have vast potential to transform data-driven nudging and decision making. This workshop seeks to 
        build a new community around AI for nudging and provide a platform for exploring the state of the art in AI/ML/DS 
        based systems and applications of digital nudging. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Adaptation of products and services to individual preferences, called Personalization, has been at the core of 
        modern businesses to improve customer satisfaction. Modern business and digital systems coupled with artificial 
        intelligence technologies are poised to enable personalization on a grand scale. Personalization is a key element 
        behind many modern businesses such as Netflix, Facebook, and Amazon to increase their revenue and customer base. Modern 
        businesses are tailoring content for individual users based on the social, economic, and cultural profiles 
        mined from the data, as it is shown to increase revenue and attract new customers. Modern applications ranging 
        from precision marketing to precision healthcare have shown a clear demand for personalized content. 
    
    <p>
        We invite contributions from researchers of any discipline who are developing AI/ML/DS technologies that impact 
        human behavior based on nudging theory or personalizaion or behavioral science-based solutions. For example, in the context of 
        public health communications, how can AI/ML be used to address the construction of a message incorporating nudges; 
        how do you digitally nudge people towards better healthcare outcomes, better financial decisions, or improve 
        productivity; or how can nudging be personalized? What are the key data, technology, privacy and ethical, adoptation, 
        and scaling challenges in nudging and personalization? In addition to algorithmic and systems papers, case studies 
        that shed light on the effectiveness of nudges and personalization at maximizing a specific outcome, how AI/ML based systems can 
        nudge people to make better decisions, or how industry is developing and/or using nudging and personalization technology to influence 
        behavior of consumers are of great interest to this workshop.
