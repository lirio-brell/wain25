    <h2>What this workshop is about?</h2>
    <p>
        Thaler and Sunstein (2008) defined nudge, as "any aspect of the choice architecture that alters peopleâ€™s behavior 
        in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives." 
        As can be seen from this definition, humans (or decision makers) and organizations (both government and private) 
        use nudges to influence the behavior of target populations. The central idea is that small changes to the environment 
        in which citizens make decisions, such as placing healthy food close to supermarket checkouts, rather than banning 
        junk food, can achieve desirable changes in behavior. Thus, <span class="em">nudges</span> are typically small changes to the environment 
        that are easy and inexpensive to implement. On the other hand, <span class="em">nudging</span> is defined as the "systematic and 
        evidence-based development and implementation of  <span class="em">nudges</span> in creating behavior change." On the other hand, 
        Wikipedia defines <span class="em">personalization</span> as "tailoring a service or a product to accommodate specific individuals, 
        sometimes tied to groups or segments of individuals. A wide variety of organizations use personalization to improve customer satisfaction, 
        digital sales conversion, marketing results, branding, and improved website metrics as well as for advertising. Personalization is a key element in 
        social media and recommender systems." Data-driven approaches are increasingly being adopted in personalization and nudging tasks
        across a wide spectrum of applications. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        AI is becoming a big part of <span class="em">nudging</span> and <span class="em">personalization</span>, 
        and this workshop seeks to explore the state of the art in AI-based systems and applications of nudging and personalization.  
        This workshop seeks to build a new community around <span class="em">AI for nudging and personalization</span> and provide a platform 
        for exploring the state of the art in AI/ML/DS-based systems and applications of digital <span class="em">nudging and personalization</span>. 
        The intended audience for this workshop is researchers from academia, government, and domain sciences, and practitioners dealing with developing AI 
        technologies that impact human behavior based on <span class="em">nudging</span> theory and personalization.
